# How does it work?
This version of the snake game provides an option for the classical singleplayer snake game and two multiplayer gamemodes.
The first gamemode is called Time Rush where the players main goal is to collect as much fruits as possible for the period of time.
The second gamemode is the vanilla style in which whoever crashes first, loses.
